Their timing and location with Roach Robber do coincide and we think that there is a possibility of transshipment, especially at the Nav points.\nCompare dates at Preserve Areas, vs Dates at the Ports and Matching Illegal Fish Cargoes. From the path, we can further compare the dates that the vessels return to ports after spending time at Preserve areas, and cross check with the cargoes at that port to determine if there were any illegal cargoes offloaded. That way, we can be more certain of which vessel engage in illegal fishing and sold it at the harbor."

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\n\nProblem Statement 1: Patterns of Life of Vessels and Ports\nWhich vessels deliver which products and when?\nTo understand how the commercially catch fish flow through the various ports in Oceanus, we first have to know which vessels go to which ports. Hence, using the harbor report, we can extract the information on which of the 178 fishing vessels visit which port and when. Then, the harbor report can be corroborated with the harbor import report to match the vessel with the cargo. The harbor import records Transactions can provide with the actual fish species that were in each of the cargo. However, as the harbor report may not be 100% accurate, we will also try to corroborate the information with the transponder ping data as well as the dwell time. We can also try to find an estimate of the dwell time (time spent at one location) spent when off loading cargo and use that estimate for further analysis.\nWe will employ the following possible visualisations:\n\nSankey diagrams: To illustrate the flow of the cargo from the vessels to the port.\nBipartite graphs: To illustrate the vessel with the type of cargo - to allow for customisation based on the chosen port and duration (time-stamp).\n\nWhat are the seasonal trends and anomalies in the port exit records?\nThe harbor import records Transactions and Delivery Report provides the information of fish species, tonnage and date of the delivery. Coupling these information with the understanding of fish species availability in all the fishing grounds and ecological preserves , the seasonal trends and anomalies on how the volume (tonnage) and fish species changes over time can be analysed.\nWe will employ the following visualisations:\n\nTime Series Line Chart: To show how the tonage and fish specieis deliveries vary over time. This is to identify seasonal peak and troughs in fish deliveries and detect any unusual spikes or drops.\nHeatmaps: Provide a visual summary of fish species deliveries across different month or year. Possibly include the breakdown by each port.\nBox Plots: Summarise the distribution of deliveries by month and highlight outliers. This is to identify typical delivery volumes and periods with unusally high or low deliveries.\n\n\n\nProblem Statement 2: SouthSeafood Express Corp Illegal Activities\nIn Oceanus, there are three fishing grounds (Cod Table, Wrasse Beds and Tuna Shelf) and three ecological preserves (Ghoti Preserve, Nemo Reef and Don Limpet Preserve). Generally, a fishing vessel should not be found staying in the ecological preserves for extended duration beyond the time the vessels need to travel through the past the location.\nWhen and where did SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels perform their illegal fishing?\nFirst, we have to understand the movement of the two vessels (Snapper Snatcher and Roach Robber) owned by SouthSeafood Express Corp. By understand movement of the vessels through Oceanus, we can identify if any of the two vessels over stayed in any of the ecological preserves. This is a sign of illegal fishing.\nWe will employ the following visualisations:\n\nNetwork graph: To understand the movements of the vessels and identify where SouthSeafood Express Corp perform their illegal fishing.\nScatter Plot: Plot vessel locations on a map, with points colored based on the duration of stay. This allows for easy identification of illegal stays. Interactivity to include information on date,time,dwell and vessel name\n\nHow do their movement and catch contents compare to other fishing vessels?\nThis can be analysed through the harbor import records Transactions and Delivery Report, in conjunction with the harbor report to match the instances the two vessels were in the ports and what related cargo and content delivered through the port.\n\nBar Chart: Compare the total tonnage of catch for SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels with other fishing vessels.\nScatter Plot: Plot the frequency of port visits for SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels against other fishing vessels to compare their movement patterns.\nBox Plot: Show the distribution of catch sizes for SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels and other fishing vessels to compare the variability in catch contents.\n\nHow many different types of suspicious behaviors are observed?\nOther than going to the ecological preserves for extended period of time, analysis can be on what other vessels differs from the usual movement between fishing ground and ports. One of the suspicious activity could be extended period of movement around the port without docking. This behaviour is called Transshipping. With transshipping, vessels can transfer their fish catch to another boat, called a refrigerated cargo vessel, and refuel at sea to avoid having to go into port. Hence, in this analysis, we will study the Vessel Movement provided by the Oceanus Vessel Location System (OVLS) to verify if there are anomalies in behaviours such as Transshipping.\nWe will employ the following visualisations:\n\nScatter Plot: Plot vessel locations on a map, with points colored based on the duration of stay. This allows for easy identification of illegal stays. Interactivity to include information on date,time,dwell and vessel name\n\n\n\nProblem Statement 3: Other Vessels Suspicious Activities\nDiscovering other vessels engaging in behaviors similar to SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal activities\nWe will first have to map out the behaviour and patterns of SouthSeafood Express to know what / where are they engaging in illegal activities. We can possibly identify this by their movement pattern within Oceanus, also looking at their dwell times at the various locations, especially areas in restricted areas.\nSome possible visualisations can include:\n\nGeographical plots of the movement pattern with temporal analysis - to look at the typical movement pattern, or any sudden changes in directions, or lingering in restricted areas.\nGraphs to highlight periods (or timeline) where SouthSeafood Express was active.\n\nThereafter, we will try to compare the patterns with other vessels to see if any of them have similar patterns or behaviours. Visualisations that we can use include:\n\nInteractive Maps: Create interactive maps that allow analysts to explore vessel movements and fishing zones.\nTimelines and Heatmaps: Develop timelines and heatmaps to visualize temporal and spatial patterns of activity.\nComparative Charts: Use bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to compare activities and catch data between SouthSeafood Express Corp and other vessels\n\n\n\nProblem Statement 4: Identifying Suspicious New Behaviors\nHow did fishing activity change after SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught?\nSouthSeafood Express Corp’s vessels, have ceased operation since 2035-05-12 at City of Himark for Roach Robber and 2035-05-14 at City of Lomark for Snapper Snatcher.\nHence, we will study the period before and after 2035-05-14 to analyse the changes in pattern. There are two areas that we can zoom into:\n\nCompare the vessels movements before and after using the the Vessel Movement data and highlight the changes in volume of traffic to various ports, navigation points, fishing grounds and ecological reserves.\nCompare the catch content and cargo volume before and after using the harbor import records.\n\nWhat new behaviors in the Oceanus commercial fishing community are most suspicious and why?\nWe will study the Vessel Movement provided by the Oceanus Vessel Location System (OVLS) to verify if there are anomalies in behaviours such as Transshipping.\nWe will employ the following visualisations:\n\nLine Chart: Plot the frequency of visits to various locations over time before and after the specified dates.\nHeatmap: Visualize the distribution of vessel movements across different locations before and after to identify any spatial patterns.\nBar Chart: Compare the total cargo volume before and after the specified dates.\nStacked Bar Chart: Show the composition of catch content (types of fish) before and after to identify any shifts in composition."

It undermines conservation efforts, depletes fish stocks, and distorts markets by introducing illegally caught fish into the supply chain. IUU fishing also compromises food security, especially for communities that rely heavily on fish as a primary protein source. By tackling IUU fishing, we can protect marine biodiversity, ensure the long-term sustainability of fisheries, promote fair trade practices, and uphold the livelihoods of those dependent on legal fishing activities. Effective measures against IUU fishing are crucial for maintaining healthy oceans and resilient coastal communities.\n\n\nKey Tasks under MC2\nThe following are the key tasks:\nFishEye analysts need your help to perform geographic and temporal analysis of the CatchNet data so they can prevent illegal fishing from happening again. Your task is to develop new visual analytics tools and workflows that can be used to discover and understand signatures of different types of behavior. Can you use your tool to visualize a signature of SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal behavior? FishEye needs your help to develop a workflow to find other instances of illegal behavior.\n\nFishEye analysts have long wanted to better understand the flow of commercially caught fish through Oceanus’s many ports. But as they were loading data into CatchNet, they discovered they had purchased the wrong port records. They wanted to get the ship off-load records, but they instead got the port-exit records (essentially trucks/trains leaving the port area). Port exit records do not include which vessel that delivered the products. Given this limitation, develop a visualization system to associate vessels with their probable cargos. Which vessels deliver which products and when? What are the seasonal trends and anomalies in the port exit records?\nDevelop visualizations that illustrate the inappropriate behavior of SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels. How do their movement and catch contents compare to other fishing vessels? When and where did SouthSeafood Express Corp vessels perform their illegal fishing? How many different types of suspicious behaviors are observed? Use visual evidence to justify your conclusions.\nTo support further Fisheye investigations, develop visual analytics workflows that allow you to discover other vessels engaging in behaviors similar to SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal activities?

Typically, the movement of ships and goods are a sign of Oceanus’s healthy economy, especially in the fishing business. But mundane routines can be disrupted by a major event. Analysts at FishEye International, a non-profit organization that aims to find and prevent illegal fishing, need your help to better understand one such event.\nFishEye has learned that SouthSeafood Express Corp has been caught fishing illegally. The scandal caused a major disruption in the close-knit fishing community. FishEye has been collecting data on ship movements and shipping records in hopes that they could assemble a cohesive store of knowledge that will allow them to better understand local commercial fishing behavior. FishEye processed open-source and commercial vessel tracking and shipping records into CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph. Analysts examine and correct data as it is loaded but need your help to create analytical capabilities for this data.\nThis project by Cheng Chun Chieh, Liang Xiuhao, Zhang Wenjing aims to provide FishEye visualisations and tools to explore the movement patterns of the fishing vessels in Oceanus, using SouthSeafood Express as the example of illegal fishing activities."

    "text": "In order to understand the change in fishing activities, we first have to determine the date where SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught. The final activities of SouthSeafood’s vessels are on 2035-05-14 at City of Lomark for Snapper Snatcher (snappersnatcher7be) and 2035-05-12 at City of Himark for Roach Robber (roachrobberdb6) according to the transponder pings. Hence, we can conclude that the SouthSeafood is caught for illegal fishing, and had ceased operating its fishing vessels since 2035-05-14. We will use this date as the cut off to define before and after SouthSeafood was caught.\n\n\nFirstly, we take a look at the species caught across the months (Feb to Nov 2035).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor recapitulation, we know that Sockfish, Offidiaa, and Helenaa are fish species that are unique to the three Preserves. From the two plots above, we can derive initial conclusion that there is an usual increase in Sockfish catch after SouthSeafood was caught in mid-May. We also see a minor increase in Helenaa between Jun to Aug, and later in Oct to Nov. The spike in Offidiaa catch begins in Sep and grows gradually to Nov. There is also appearance of Salmon from Jul onwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from the visualisation\n\n\n\nCombining the information above, we can make the following two hypothesis about the changes in fishing activities in Oceanus after SouthSeafood was caught:\n\nThe fishing vessels switched to Don Limpet Preserve for IUU fishing. Tell tale sign is the increase in Sockfish catch, which is species unique to Don Limpet Preserve. This also explains the slight increase in Helena catch from Jun.\nThe fishing vessels moved into Ghoti Preserves from Sep onwards for IUU fishing.

From the two plots above, we can derive initial conclusion that there is an usual increase in Sockfish catch after SouthSeafood was caught in mid-May. We also see a minor increase in Helenaa between Jun to Aug, and later in Oct to Nov. The spike in Offidiaa catch begins in Sep and grows gradually to Nov. There is also appearance of Salmon from Jul onwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from the visualisation\n\n\n\nCombining the information above, we can make the following two hypothesis about the changes in fishing activities in Oceanus after SouthSeafood was caught:\n\nThe fishing vessels switched to Don Limpet Preserve for IUU fishing. Tell tale sign is the increase in Sockfish catch, which is species unique to Don Limpet Preserve. This also explains the slight increase in Helena catch from Jun.\nThe fishing vessels moved into Ghoti Preserves from Sep onwards for IUU fishing.
