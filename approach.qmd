# Three Parts to the Project

The team divided the project into three key parts:

## Part 1 - Analysis of the Data

In the first part of the project, the team went through the dataset provided, which comprised two files:

-   geojson file of the locations in Oceanus

-   and a graph data, which covers Vessel Movement, Harbor Records, and Harbor Import Records.

For the nodes, we have:

Further data analysis done will be highlighted under the Data Analysis tab. Also, through the analysis, the team also tried to tag the Harbor Import Records to the vessels, and this analysis can be found under Matching Records.

## Part 2 - Understanding IUU through SouthSeaFood Express

After we performed the data analysis, we will try to learn more about IUU through the activities of SouthSeaFood Express.

This include check the vessels under this company, looking at the paths in Oceanus, where they visited and stayed and what activities were suspicious.

An understanding of their activities would help us to identify other IUU activities, which leads us to the last part.

## Part 3 - Discover IUU activities and Identify New Behaviours

With a better understanding of the IUU activities, we will go back to the data and try to filter out vessels or import records that are similar to the activities conducted by SouthSeaFood Express.

Thereafter, we will also compare the trends and activities - such as the dwell time in the Preserve areas, or any change in the paths of the vessel to try to identify new behaviours.
